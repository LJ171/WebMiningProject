# Open Questions
1. Please be a bit more specific on your data preprocessing, because it is unclear how you identify data that will be deleted.
2. Which specific collaborative filtering/ content based filtering methods do you plan to apply?
3. Which specific sentiment analysis methods do you plan to apply?

# Question 1
- the quality of the data is already quiet solid, not too much to do here, basically we just wanna take a subsample only containing users and products with at least 10 mentions in the data
	- other than that we only need to do some stuff (see below) with the free text for the sentiment analysis
- the idea was subsampling 
	- users with more then 10 interactions
	- items with more than 10 ratings
- some more data preprocessing is needed
	- e.g. stop word removal, punctuation -> for sentiment analysis
- repeat what we wrote in the proposal and asks if they can tell us what is unclear
- maybe the confusion is about "deleting missing data" 
	- we meant removing data with missing values e.g. no category, product id etc. 

# Question 2
- collaborative filtering
	- we got explicit ratings
	- create user-item matrix and filtering -> similarity
- content based
	- creating some kind of classification or regression model based on the metadata provided for every product

# Question 3 
- vectorize the text e.g. tf-idf

# Moving Forward
Vishal - Content-based
Lars - Colaborative
Vincent & Emanuela - Sentiment Analysis
Rozalinda - improve preprocessing part 

=> update the overleaf until this evening/ tomorrow morning -> let us know in the WhatsApp group when you are done so we can resend it
