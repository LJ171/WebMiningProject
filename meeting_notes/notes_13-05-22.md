# Coaching Session
next Thursday -> 1:45pm to 2:00pm

- need a presentation
 -> small one, just a few slides 
 -> Lars will share a powerpoint link later

# What has been done?
## collab filtering
- 3 models (1 base line, 2 actual models)

## content based
- 1 baseline model 
- exploring expanding this model 

## sentiment analysis
- baseline model works with RMSE of ~1
- naive bayes has been implemented 

# Next Steps 
- upload code to Github
- On Monday:
- - discuss how we can create the hybrid model
- - prepare for the coaching session 
- expand the content-based model to predict a rating (just do weighted average, similar to the collab filtering)
